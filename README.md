5.Extended application:
(1) You can use Calculate Muse Offset in your other UI, such as map. This MACROS can map the mouse viewport position to the UI panel that has been scaled and offset at different resolutions, in order to achieve smooth movement of the UI on the scaled and offset UI panel.
(2) You can design the Custom Blueprint System as a puzzle solving system to increase gameplay
(3) You can encapsulate some functions into BPNodes to allow players to implement in-game programming, greatly increasing gameplay
(4) You can use it in some visualization scenarios, etc
